I've found many C++ open sources that had implemented MaxHeap, MinHeap, MaxPriorityQueue, MinPriorityQueue in a good way without a flaw.
But I could not find any Swift source that made it perfect.
Therefore, I have created this to help other Swift engineers.
I have tested various ways to make sure that the source is perfect.
